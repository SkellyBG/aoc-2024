# Advent of Code 2024

This is my repository for Advent of Code! This is my first year using Rust, so I'm still improving my ability to write idiomatic code!

This repo is setup using [cargo-aoc](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc) - a CLI tool to automatically download input and run benchmark against my solution.
